# Artificial Worldviews â€” Dataset  

This repository contains the datasets used in the [Artificial Worldviews](https://artificial-worldviews.kimalbrecht.com) project.  
The project systematically queried **GPT-3.5** in 2023 (Knowledge) and 2024 (Power) to uncover how the model organizes and describes the world. The result is a large-scale dataset mapping the modelâ€™s implicit *worldview* â€” its categories, biases, and unexpected structures.  

## Contents  

The dataset is split into two main files:  

- **artificial-worldviews-knowledge.tsv** â€” responses related to fields of knowledge (e.g., science, philosophy, art).  
- **artificial-worldviews-power.tsv** â€” responses related to domains of power (e.g., politics, economy, technology).  

Each file contains:  
- **field** â€” the main category (e.g., Physics, Governance).  
- **subfield** â€” more specific domain (e.g., Quantum Mechanics, International Relations).  
- **name** â€” human or object related to that subfield.  
- **category** â€” type of entity (e.g., person, institution, concept).  
- **description** â€” short text generated by GPT-3.5.  
- **related_things** â€” list of related people, objects, or concepts.  
- **importance_score** â€” relative significance within the subfield.  

Files are provided as **TSV spreadsheets** and can be explored in Excel, Google Sheets, or programmatically.  

A live version of the dataset is also accessible here:

## How the Data Was Collected  

- **Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`  
- **Queries**: 1,764 API calls across 425 subfields  
- **Method**: Each subfield queried twice, at temperature `0` (deterministic) and `0.5` (varied).  
- **Output Size**: Each query returned 5â€“40 entries depending on the subfield.  

## Possible Uses  

- Explore the **implicit classifications** embedded in large language models.  
- Analyze **biases and cultural assumptions** in AI-generated knowledge.  
- Use as a **starting point for data visualization, art projects, or critical research**.  
- Compare with other datasets to study how AI organizes human concepts.  

## Limitations & Ethics  

- This dataset contains **model outputs only** â€” not factual truth.  
- Results reflect **biases** in GPT-3.5â€™s training data (e.g., cultural assumptions, stereotypes).  
- Treat this as an **artifact of AI culture**, not a definitive account of knowledge or power.
